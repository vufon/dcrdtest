Package types implements concrete types for marshalling to and from the dcrd
JSON-RPC commands, return values, and notifications.  A comprehensive suite of
tests is provided to ensure proper functionality.

The provided types are automatically registered with
[dcrjson](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/dcrjson) when the package
is imported.  Although this package was primarily written for dcrd, it has
intentionally been designed so it can be used as a standalone package for any
projects needing to marshal to and from dcrd JSON-RPC requests and responses.

## Installation and Updating

This package is part of the `github.com/decred/dcrd/rpc/jsonrpc/types/v2`
module.  Use the standard go tooling for working with modules to incorporate it.
