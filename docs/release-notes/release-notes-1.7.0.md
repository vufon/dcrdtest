  * Additional per-connection read limits
  * A more strict cross origin request policy
  * A new alternative client authentication mechanism based on TLS certificates
  * Availability of the scripting language version for transaction outputs
  * Several other notable updates, additions, and removals related to the JSON-RPC API
* New developer modules:
  * Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters
  * Fixed-Precision Unsigned 256-bit Integers
  * Standard Scripts
  * Standard Addresses
* Infrastructure improvements
* Quality assurance changes

For those unfamiliar with the
[voting process](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview/)
in Decred, all code needed in order to support each of the aforementioned
consensus changes is already included in this release, however it will remain
dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.

For reference, the consensus change work for each of the four changes was
originally proposed and approved for initial implementation via the following
Politeia proposals:
- [Decentralized Treasury Spending](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/c96290a)
- [Explicit Version Upgrades Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861)
- [Automatic Ticket Revocations Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d)
- [Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split From 60/30 to 10/80](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4)

The following Decred Change Proposals (DCPs) describe the proposed changes in
detail and provide full technical specifications:
- [DCP0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki)
- [DCP0008](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)
- [DCP0009](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)
- [DCP0010](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki)

## Upgrade Required

**It is extremely important for everyone to upgrade their software to this
latest release even if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.  This
particularly applies to PoW miners as failure to upgrade will result in lost
rewards after block height 635775.  That is estimated to be around Feb 21st,
2022.**

## Downgrade Warning

The database format in v1.7.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the
software.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous
versions will see a one time database migration.

Once this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to
downgrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the
database and redownload the chain.

The database migration typically takes around 40-50 minutes on HDDs and 20-30
minutes on SSDs.

## Notable Changes

### Four New Consensus Change Votes

Four new consensus change votes are now available as of this release.  After
upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences through their wallet.

#### Revert Treasury Maximum Expenditure Policy Vote

The first new vote available as of this release has the id `reverttreasurypolicy`.

The primary goal of this change is to revert the currently active maximum
expenditure policy of the decentralized Treasury to the one specified in the
[original Politeia proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/c96290a).

See [DCP0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki) for
the full technical specification.

#### Explicit Version Upgrades Vote

The second new vote available as of this release has the id `explicitverupgrades`.

The primary goals of this change are to:

* Provide an easy, reliable, and efficient method for software and hardware to
  determine exactly which rules should be applied to transaction and script
  versions
* Further embrace the increased security and other desirable properties that
  hard forks provide over soft forks

See the following for more details:

* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861)
* [DCP0008](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)

#### Automatic Ticket Revocations Vote

The third new vote available as of this release has the id `autorevocations`.

The primary goals of this change are to:

* Improve the Decred stakeholder user experience by removing the requirement for
  stakeholders to manually revoke missed and expired tickets
* Enable the recovery of funds for users who lost their redeem script for the
  legacy VSP system (before the release of vspd, which removed the need for the
  redeem script)

See the following for more details:

* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d)
* [DCP0009](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)

#### Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split to 10/80 Vote

The fourth new vote available as of this release has the id `changesubsidysplit`.

The proposed modification to the subsidy split is intended to substantially
diminish the ability to attack Decred's markets with mined coins and improve
decentralization of the issuance process.

See the following for more details:

* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4)
* [DCP0010](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki)

### Substantially Reduced Initial Sync Time

The amount of time it takes to complete the initial chain synchronization
process has been substantially reduced.  With default settings, it is around 48%
faster versus the previous release.

### Unspent Transaction Output Overhaul

The way unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are handled has been significantly
reworked to provide major performance enhancements to both steady-state
operation as well as the initial chain sync process as follows:

* Each UTXO is now tracked independently on a per-output basis
* The UTXOs now reside in a dedicated database
* All UTXO reads and writes now make use of a cache

#### Unspent Transaction Output Cache

All reads and writes of unspent transaction outputs (utxos) now go through a
cache that sits on top of the utxo set database which drastically reduces the
amount of reading and writing to disk, especially during the initial sync
process when a very large number of blocks are being processed in quick
succession.

This utxo cache provides significant runtime performance benefits at the cost of
some additional memory usage.  The maximum size of the cache can be configured
with the new `--utxocachemaxsize` command-line configuration option.  The
default value is 150 MiB, the minimum value is 25 MiB, and the maximum value is
32768 MiB (32 GiB).

Some key properties of the cache are as follows:

* For reads, the UTXO cache acts as a read-through cache
  * All UTXO reads go through the cache
  * Cache misses load the missing data from the disk and cache it for future lookups
* For writes, the UTXO cache acts as a write-back cache
  * Writes to the cache are acknowledged by the cache immediately, but are only
    periodically flushed to disk
* Allows intermediate steps to effectively be skipped thereby avoiding the need
  to write millions of entries to disk
* On average, recent UTXOs are much more likely to be spent in upcoming blocks
  than older UTXOs, so only the oldest UTXOs are evicted as needed in order to
  maximize the hit ratio of the cache
* The cache is periodically flushed with conditional eviction:
  * When the cache is NOT full, nothing is evicted, but the changes are still
    written to the disk set to allow for a quicker reconciliation in the case of
    an unclean shutdown
  * When the cache is full, 15% of the oldest UTXOs are evicted

### Faster Cryptographic Signature Validation

Some aspects of the underlying crypto code has been updated to further improve
its execution speed and reduce the number of memory allocations resulting in
about a 1% reduction to signature verification time.

The primary benefits are:

* Improved vote times since blocks and transactions propagate more quickly
  throughout the network
* Approximately a 2% reduction to the duration of the initial sync process

### Significant Improvements to Network Synchronization

The method used to obtain blocks from other peers on the network is now guided
entirely by block headers.  This provides a wide variety of benefits, but the
most notable ones for most users are:

* Faster initial synchronization
* Reduced bandwidth usage
* Enhanced protection against attempted DoS attacks
* Percentage-based progress reporting
* Improved steady state logging

### Support for Configurable Assumed Valid Block

This release introduces a new model for deciding when several historical
validation checks may be skipped for blocks that are an ancestor of a known good
block.

Specifically, a new `AssumeValid` parameter is now used to specify the
aforementioned known good block.  The default value of the parameter is updated
with each release to a recent block that is part of the main chain.

The default value of the parameter can be overridden with the `--assumevalid`
command-line option by setting it as follows:

* `--assumevalid=0`: Disable the feature resulting in no skipped validation checks
* `--assumevalid=[blockhash]`:  Set `AssumeValid` to the specified block hash

Specifying a block hash closer to the current best chain tip allows for faster
syncing.  This is useful since the validation requirements increase the longer a
particular release build is out as the default known good block becomes deeper
in the chain.

### Block Index Memory Usage Reduction

The block index that keeps track of block status and connectivity now occupies
around 30MiB less memory and scales better as more blocks are added to the
chain.

### Asynchronous Indexing

The various optional indexes are now created asynchronously versus when
blocks are processed as was previously the case.

This permits blocks to be validated more quickly when the indexes are enabled
since the validation no longer needs to wait for the indexing operations to
complete.

In order to help keep consistent behavior for RPC clients, RPCs that involve
interacting with the indexes will not return results until the associated
indexing operation completes when the indexing tip is close to the current best
chain tip.

One side effect of this change that RPC clients should be aware of is that it is
now possible to receive sync timeout errors on RPCs that involve interacting
with the indexes if the associated indexing tip gets so far behind it would end
up delaying results for too long.  In practice, errors of this type are rare and
should only ever be observed during the initial sync process before the
associated indexes are current.  However, callers should be aware of the
possibility and handle the error accordingly.

The following RPCs are affected:

* `existsaddress`
* `existsaddresses`
* `getrawtransaction`
* `searchrawtransactions`

### Version 1 Block Filters Removal

The previously deprecated version 1 block filters are no longer available on the
peer-to-peer network.  Use
[version 2 block filters](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#version-2-block-filters)
with their associated
[block header commitment](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#block-header-commitments)
and [inclusion proof](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#verifying-commitment-root-inclusion-proofs)
instead.

### RPC Server Changes

The RPC server version as of this release is 7.0.0.

#### Max Request Limits

The RPC server now imposes the following additional per-connection read limits
to help further harden it against potential abuse in non-standard configurations
on poorly-configured networks:

* 0 B / 8 MiB for pre and post auth HTTP connections
* 4 KiB / 16 MiB for pre and post auth WebSocket connections

In practice, these changes will not have any noticeable effect for the vast
majority of nodes since the RPC server is not publicly accessible by default and
also requires authentication.

Nevertheless, it can still be useful for scenarios such as authenticated fuzz
testing and improperly-configured networks that have disabled all other security
measures.

#### More Strict Cross Origin Request (CORS) Policy

The CORS policy for WebSocket clients is now more strict and rejects requests
from other domains.

In practice, CORS requests will be rejected before ever reaching that point due
to the use of a self-signed TLS certificate and the requirement for
authentication to issue any commands.  However, additional protection mechanisms
make it that much more difficult to attack by providing defense in depth.

#### Alternative Client Authentication Method Based on TLS Certificates

A new alternative method for TLS clients to authenticate to the RPC server by
presenting a client certificate in the TLS handshake is now available.

Under this authentication method, the certificate authority for a client
certificate must be added to the RPC server as a trusted root in order for it to
trust the client.  Once activated, clients will no longer be required to provide
HTTP Basic authentication nor use the `authenticate` RPC in the case of
WebSocket clients.

Note that while TLS client authentication has the potential to ultimately allow
more fine grained access controls on a per-client basis, it currently only
supports clients with full administrative privileges.  In other words, it is not
currently compatible with the `--rpclimituser` and `--rpclimitpass` mechanism,
so users depending on the limited user settings should avoid the new
authentication method for now.

The new authentication type can be activated with the `--authtype=clientcert`
configuration option.

By default, the trusted roots are loaded from the `clients.pem` file in dcrd's
application data directory, however, that location can be modified via the
`--clientcafile` option if desired.

#### Updates to Transaction Output Query RPC (`gettxout`)

The `gettxout` RPC has the following modifications:

* An additional `tree` parameter is now required in order to explicitly identify
  the exact transaction output being requested
* The transaction `version` field is no longer available in the primary JSON
  object of the results
* The child `scriptPubKey` JSON object in the results now includes a new
  `version` field that identifies the scripting language version

See the
[gettxout JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettxout)
for API details.

#### Removal of Stake Difficulty Notification RPCs (`notifystakedifficulty` and `stakedifficulty`)

The deprecated `notifystakedifficulty` and `stakedifficulty` WebSocket-only RPCs
are no longer available.  This notification is unnecessary since the difficulty
change interval is well defined.  Callers may obtain the difficulty via
`getstakedifficulty` at the appropriate difficulty change intervals instead.

See the
[getstakedifficulty JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getstakedifficulty)
for API details.

#### Removal of Version 1 Filter RPCs (`getcfilter` and `getcfilterheader`)

The deprecated `getcfilter` and `getcfilterheader` RPCs, which were previously
used to obtain version 1 block filters via RPC are no longer available. Use
`getcfilterv2` instead.

See the
[getcfilterv2 JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getcfilterv2)
for API details.

#### New Median Time Field on Block Query RPCs (`getblock` and `getblockheader`)

The verbose results of the `getblock` and `getblockheader` RPCs now include a
`mediantime` field that specifies the median block time associated with the
block.

See the following for API details:

* [getblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblock)
* [getblockheader JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblockheader)

#### New Scripting Language Version Field on Raw Transaction RPCs (`getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `searchrawtransactions`, and `getblock`)

The verbose results of the `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`,
`searchrawtransactions`, and `getblock` RPCs now include a `version` field in
the child `scriptPubKey` JSON object that identifies the scripting language
version.

See the following for API details:

* [getrawtransaction JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getrawtransaction)
* [decoderawtransaction JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#decoderawtransaction)
* [searchrawtransactions JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#searchrawtransactions)
* [getblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblock)

#### New Treasury Add Transaction Filter on Mempool Query RPC (`getrawmempool`)

The transaction type parameter of the `getrawmempool` RPC now accepts `tadd` to
only include treasury add transactions in the results.

See the
[getrawmempool JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getrawmempool)
for API details.

#### New Manual Block Invalidation and Reconsideration RPCs (`invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock`)

A new pair of RPCs named `invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock` are now
available.  These RPCs can be used to manually invalidate a block as if it had
violated consensus rules and reconsider a block for validation and best chain
selection by removing any invalid status from it and its ancestors, respectively.

This capability is provided for development, testing, and debugging.  It can be
particularly useful when developing services that build on top of Decred to more
easily ensure edge conditions associated with invalid blocks and chain
reorganization are being handled properly.

These RPCs do not apply to regular users and can safely be ignored outside of
development.

See the following for API details:

* [invalidateblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#invalidateblock)
* [reconsiderblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#reconsiderblock)

### Reject Protocol Message Deprecated (`reject`)

The `reject` peer-to-peer protocol message is now deprecated and is scheduled to
be removed in a future release.

This message is a holdover from the original codebase where it was required, but
it really is not a useful message and has several downsides:

* Nodes on the network must be trustless, which means anything relying on such a
  message is setting itself up for failure because nodes are not obligated to
  send it at all nor be truthful as to the reason
* It can be harmful to privacy as it allows additional node fingerprinting
* It can lead to security issues for implementations that don't handle it with
  proper sanitization practices
* It can easily give software implementations the fully incorrect impression
  that it can be relied on for determining if transactions and blocks are valid
* The only way it is actually used currently is to show a debug log message,
  however, all of that information is already available via the peer and/or wire
  logging anyway
* It carries a non-trivial amount of development overhead to continue to support
  it when nothing actually uses it

### No DNS Seeds Command-Line Option Deprecated (`--nodnsseed`)

The `--nodnsseed` command-line configuration option is now deprecated and will
be removed in a future release.  Use `--noseeders` instead.

DNS seeding has not been used since the previous release.

## Notable New Developer Modules

### Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters

A new `github.com/decred/dcrd/container/apbf` module is now available that
provides Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters (APBFs).

An APBF is a probabilistic lookup device that can quickly determine if it
contains an element.  It permits tracking large amounts of data while using very
little memory at the cost of a controlled rate of false positives.  Unlike
classic Bloom filters, it is able to handle an unbounded amount of data by aging
and discarding old items.

For a concrete example of actual savings achieved in Decred by making use of an
APBF, the memory to track addresses known by 125 peers was reduced from ~200 MiB
to ~5 MiB.

See the
[apbf module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/container/apbf)
for full details on usage, accuracy under workloads, expected memory usage, and
performance benchmarks.

### Fixed-Precision Unsigned 256-bit Integers

A new `github.com/decred/dcrd/math/uint256` module is now available that provides
highly optimized allocation free fixed precision unsigned 256-bit integer
arithmetic.

The package has a strong focus on performance and correctness and features
arithmetic, boolean comparison, bitwise logic, bitwise shifts, conversion
to/from relevant types, and full formatting support - all served with an
ergonomic API, full test coverage, and benchmarks.

Every operation is faster than the standard library `big.Int` equivalent and the
primary math operations provide reductions of over 90% in the calculation time.
Most other operations are also significantly faster.

See the
[uint256 module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/math/uint256)
for full details on usage, including a categorized summary, and performance
benchmarks.

### Standard Scripts

A new `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdscript` package is now available
that provides facilities for identifying and extracting data from transaction
scripts that are considered standard by the default policy of most nodes.

The package is part of the `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4` module.

See the
[stdscript package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdscript)
for full details on usage and a list of the recognized standard scripts.

### Standard Addresses

A new `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdaddr` package is now available that
provides facilities for working with human-readable Decred payment addresses.

The package is part of the `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4` module.

See the
[stdaddr package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdaddr)
for full details on usage and a list of the supported addresses.
